# Garage S3 Storage
Garage must have a configuration file `garage.toml` configured and mounted in the container to function.

There is also some setup required inside the container on the first run, and
for creating and assigning permissions for buckets.

Relevant documentation can be found [here](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/documentation/quick-start/).

Note that you must make a cluster of at least 1 node to begin using garage.
